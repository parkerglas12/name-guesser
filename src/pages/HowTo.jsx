          Each question provides you with two images that will act as your
          hints. There's hidden (or at times not-so-hidden) symbolism within the
          pictures that will represent a famous person.

        <p className="text-sm">
          Always enter the name they're most known for. Examples: Michael B.
          Jordan, Martin Luther King jr., Drake, etc. Also, don't worry about
          capitalization, but don't add extra space between words.

        <h2 className="text-md text-center">Decode The Details</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Some hints are obvious, others more subtle. Use logic, culture,
          history, and a bit of intuition to make the connection.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm">
          The answer will always be a real human being. No fictional characters
          from books or movies. However, the actors who portray them can be
          correct answers.

        <h2 className="text-md text-center">Enter Or Click</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Once you know the answer, press the Enter/Return key or click the
          Submit button. If the input isn’t active, click inside the box to
          start typing.

          Every question is rated from 1 to 5 stars. Additionally, the number
          shown beneath each image pair is that question’s unique code, not your
          current progress in the round.

        <h2 className="text-md text-center">Fast Pays</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          There’s no scary countdown timer, but answering quickly earns you more
          points. Take your time—but be aware of the clock ticking behind the
          scenes.

        <h2 className="text-md text-center">What's The Point?</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Each question starts at 50 points multiplied by it's rating (number of
          stars), and you lose 1 point every second. The minimum score for a
          correct answer is 10 points.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-md text-center">Round and Round</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          A round consists of 10 random questions, with difficulty increasing as
          you go. You can play as many rounds per day as you’d like.
