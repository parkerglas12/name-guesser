          Each question provides you with two images that will act as your
          hints. There's hidden (or at times not-so-hidden) symbolism within the
          pictures that will represent a famous person.

          It's best to use the name they are most known by. Examples include:
          Michael B. Jordan, Martin Luther King Jr., and Drake. Other variations
          will likely also be accepted.

        <p className="text-sm">
          Some hints are obvious, others more subtle. Use logic, culture,
          history, and a bit of intuition to make the connection.

          The answer will always be a real human being. No fictional characters
          from books or movies. However, the actors who portray them can be
          correct answers.

          Once you know the answer, press the Enter/Return key or click the

          Every question is rated from 1 to 5 stars. Additionally, the number
          shown beneath each image pair is that question’s unique code, not your
          current progress in the round.

        <h2 className="text-md text-center">30 Seconds...</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          You have 30 seconds to answer each question, with only one attempt
          allowed. If the timer runs out, the question is automatically marked
          incorrect.

        <h2 className="text-md text-center">What's The Point?</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Each question starts at 50 points multiplied by its rating (number of
          stars), and you lose points for every second that passes by.

          A round consists of 10 random questions, with difficulty increasing as
          you go. You can play as many rounds per day as you’d like.
